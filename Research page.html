        <h1>The Titanic Incident - A Comprehensive Research</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The RMS Titanic, a British passenger liner, sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early hours of April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The sinking resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 passengers and crew, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.
            </p>

            <h2>The Ship</h2>
            <p>
                The Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage. She was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line, and she was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Her design included advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors.

            <h2>The Voyage</h2>
            <p>
                Titanic's maiden voyage began on April 10, 1912. After leaving Southampton, she called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland before heading west to New York. On the night of April 14, 1912, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 PM ship's time.

            <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
            <p>
                The collision caused the ship's hull plates to buckle inwards in a number of locations, flooding five of her sixteen watertight compartments. Over the next two and a half hours, the ship gradually filled with water and sank. The lack of lifeboats and inadequacies in the evacuation process led to a significant loss of life. The disaster led to major improvements in maritime safety regulations.

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                The sinking of the Titanic has been the subject of numerous books, articles, and films, including the 1997 blockbuster "Titanic" directed by James Cameron. The wreck of the Titanic was discovered in 1985, more than 70 years after the disaster, and has since been extensively explored. The incident remains a poignant reminder of the human cost of hubris and the importance of safety regulations.
